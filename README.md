# Data Analysis

This repository showcases my abilities to clean and transform messy or dirty data. The dataset is from the [how much money do you make?](https://www.askamanager.org/2021/04/how-much-money-do-you-make-4.html) survey with its answers compiled in a [Google Sheets document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IPS5dBSGtwYVbjsfbaMCYIWnOuRmJcbequohNxCyGVw/edit#gid=1625408792) and it is from July 4th 2024.

To understand the dataset better, I'll conduct exploratory data analysis to answer questions such as:

- Which industry pays the most?
- How does salary increase given years of experience?
